## CHAPTER X.

### COMBAT BETWEEN THE HORATII AND CURIATII.

The Romans were always trying, by every means in their power, by force of arms or artful schemes, to extend their dominion. Their king, [Tullus Hostilius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tullus_Hostilius), under pretence that the peasants of the nation of [Alba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alba_Longa) had plundered his subjects, sent ambassadors to demand restitution of the goods they had taken away. He knew that the Albans would refuse satisfaction, because the Romans had also robbed them; and it turned out as he expected. War was therefore declared between the two nations.

When the opposing armies met, the general of the Albans, [Mitius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mettius_Fufetius), averse to the shedding of so much blood, proposed that some other method of settling the dispute should be chosen.

It happened that in each army there were three brothers born at a birth. [Those on the Roman side were called Horatii, and those on the Alban side, Curiatii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horatii_and_Curiatii). The kings proposed to these young men to fight, each for his own country; and whoever conquered, should be deemed to have obtained the victory for his nation.

A treaty to this effect was signed, and it was solemnly resolved, "That the nation, whose champions should come off conquerors in the combat, should reign peaceably over the other."

By the by, this is the most ancient treaty recorded in history. The armies were placed in due order; the brothers took their arms; their hearts, no doubt, beating high with the hope of victory, and happy in the assurance that, at all events, their prowess would save the lives of hundreds of their  fellow-creatures. That is the only true courage, which risks personal danger in the expectation and intention of obtaining good to our country and our fellow-creatures.

Boldly these gallant young heroes stood before their own armies, and heard the prayers of their fellow-soldiers for their success.

The signal was given. The youths rushed forward to the encounter. Presently they were engaged hand to hand, and, in the desperate conflict, felt not the wounds they received, although the spectators, with aching hearts, saw them soon covered with blood. But the glorious spirit of patriotism prevented the heroes from feeling pain; they were insensible to every thing but honor.

The three Albans were desperately wounded, and loud shouts ran along the Roman army. In a few seconds, two of the Romans fell, and expired. The acclamations were now heard among the Albans: such is the fate of war.

The surviving Roman saw that all depended upon him; it was an awful moment. But he did not despair ; he manfully roused his spirits to meet the exigence of the hour. He saw that force could not avail, for three to one were fearful odds; but he had presence of mind enough to think upon what was best to be done. How valuable is presence of mind!

Horatius drew back, as if fleeing from his enemies. I suppose you will cry out, as the Roman army did, "Shame! Shame!" But Horatius was too brave to trouble himself about what was *said*; he was only thinking of what was to be *done*.

The Curiatii pursued the retreating hero, and, as Horatius expected, one came up before the others: this was what he wanted.

When the Roman hero found one of the Albans near him, he turned about, and, exerting all his skill and bravery, he soon laid him dead at his feet. By this time another of the brothers had arrived; him, too, Horatius quickly despatched. Only one remained on each side.

The hisses of the Romans were turned into cheerings. But what was their joy, when they saw the last of the Curiatii stretched lifeless on the ground! Can you not imagine the joy of the victor when he returned triumphant to his friends?

What followed, it is painful to relate. When Horatius reached Rome, he saw his sister bitterly lamenting the death of the Curiatii, one of whom she was engaged to marry; and, in the dreadful moment of ungoverned rage, he killed her on the spot. Alas! to what crimes does not passion lead!

Horatius was condemned to die. His aged father implored the judges to show some mercy to his son; that son, whose valor had lately obtained for Rome the dominion of a new state, whose valor had saved the lives of many Romans; that son, whom he himself would have punished, had he overlooked the conduct of his weak, complaining sister.

The people could not withstand the tears and pleadings of the old father. The life of Horatius was spared. But, no doubt, he deeply lamented that his rash anger had made him tarnish the honors he had so dearly purchased.

A little before this interesting combat took place in Italy, [Holofernes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holofernes), the [Assyrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyria) general, was killed by Judith, as related in [the book which bears her name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Judith).
