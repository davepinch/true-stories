## CHAPTER IX.

### ATHENS. THESEUS.

ATHENS was the most famous city in Greece. I have already told you that [Cecrops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecrops_I), with a colony from Egypt, built it a few years before [Sparta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta) was founded.

You must know, Greece is a large tract of country in the eastern corner of Europe; and formerly it was covered with cities, each of which had its territory. Of some of these cities you have already heard: Sparta was one of them, [Corinth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Corinth) another, Argos another, and Athens, perhaps the most celebrated of them all. The country belonging to Athens was called [Attica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attica).

[Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theseus) was the most renowned of its kings; he reigned there before the Trojan war, and was the son of [Ægeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aegeus).

When he was young, it was a custom in Athens to send seven youths and seven maidens to [Minos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minos), king of [Crete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crete), as a kind of tribute; and it is said he put those victims into a place called a *labyrinth*, to be devoured by the [Minotaur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minotaur), a strange monster, partaking of the form of a man and a bull.

This was done once every ten years. When the time of the third tribute came, and the poor young people were going to be chosen by lot, Prince Theseus came forward, and voluntarily offered himself for one of the victims, without taking his chance. You may suppose the old king, his father, did not approve of this self-devotion, though at last he consented to it. The ship that took out these hapless creatures had a black sail, as an emblem, or sign, of its melancholy office; but Theseus persuaded Ægeus to give them a white sail likewise; and he promised, if he escaped the monster, and returned in safety, to hoist the white sail instead of the usual black one.

When he arrived at Crete, a young virgin, named [Ariadne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ariadne), fell in love with him, and gave him a clew of thread, with the help of which he could find his way out of the labyrinth. He therefore boldly entered it, killed the Minotaur, and then, guiding himself by the thread, came safely forth, and, with Ariadne and the young victims he had rescued, set sail for Athens.

When they drew near to Attica, they were all in such raptures of joy, that they quite forgot to hoist the white sail: so Ægeus, who was anxiously watching for the ship, concluded that his beloved son was dead, and, throwing himself from the rocks, was instantly dashed to pieces. Two great faults caused this sad calamity: Theseus had broken a promise solemnly given, and Ægeus was too impatient under trial.

The gratitude of the people for being rescued from so dreadful a custom, did not compensate to the brave son for the death of his affectionate father.

Theseus fought many battles with a race of women called [Amazonians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazons). Surprising stories are told of the courage of these valiant females; but of what is related of those dark times so little can be depended upon, that I do not wish to say much of what is so strange and incredible. I suppose, however, there was a race of women singular for their cour age and strength, as that is very possible.

After Theseus, many kings reigned in Athens: the last of them, [Codrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codrus), deserves to be remembered. He was told that Athens would not flourish until its monarch should die by the hand of an enemy; he directly went in disguise into the enemy's camp, and picked a quarrel with one of the soldiers, on purpose to rouse him to kill him, which the man soon did.

It is truly brave to die in the hope of benefiting our country. Codrus so died. [Saul](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul) was then king of [Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Israel_(united_monarchy)).

After this gallant action, Athens was governed by a magistrate, called an archon; and Medon, the son of Codrus, was the first archon.

Medon and a few of his immediate followers were archons during life. Afterwards, this magistrate governed only ten years; and lastly, he was chosen annually. We have now brought the history of Athens from its building, B.C. 1556, to the time of the foundation of Rome, B.C. 753.
