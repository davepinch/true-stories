### CREATION OF THE WORLD. THE DELUGE. BABYLON, IN CHALDEA.

We have long amused ourselves, my dear children, with tales of fiction; suppose we now seek a nobler entertainment in the study of *real* characters and the knowledge of *real* events. I assure you, fancy can offer nothing more strange or more interesting than may be found in history; and our best story-tellers and story-writers are those who speak from knowledge and experience.

You can easily understand why true stories must be more affecting than fictitious tales; why the actions of real human beings must be more instructive than the deeds of fancied heroes and heroines. In reading history, however, especially ancient history, we must not too hastily believe all that is written. In the lapse of years, the means by which facts have been recorded, such as Medals, Pictures, Hieroglyphic Inscriptions, Statues, and Manuscripts, must have been often lost, defaced, and altered. Hence the truth can scarcely be expected to reach us pure and genuine; besides, different historians relate facts in different modes, and view characters and events in different lights: we must, therefore, receive their records with diffidence and candor, and be always disposed to accept the kindest representation of our fellow-creatures.

It is absolutely necessary to all well-educated persons, to be acquainted with what is generally known and believed as the history of the various countries of the world. Such knowledge enables us to relish polite society, and join in intelligent conversation. It instructs us, by what *has* happened, to judge what *may* happen; it develops to us the powers and capacities of human virtue and human talent; and hence may teach us what we *ought* to do, and what we *can* do.

We will now, therefore, take a view of events, in the order in which they occurred; and of persons, in the order in which they lived.

The Bible gives us the account of what passed, and of the people who lived, in the earliest period of history. There, also, you will read of the great Flood; when deep water covered all the earth, and only [Noah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah) and his family, and the animals he took with him into the ark, were saved; all the rest of mankind were drowned.

Well, this great Flood, or deluge, as it is sometimes called, took place about four thousand years ago. And even now, signs of the deluge — signs that the sea once covered what is now dry land — are to be found; for, in some high mountains, far from the ocean, the bones of fish and marine animals are discovered; so that all sensible persons are sure a flood really did happen.

Look into a map of the world for Asia. The first men and women of whom we read lived in Asia; and the first city of any consequence was the famous city of [Babylon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon) — built in Asia.

[Nimrod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimrod), the great-grandson of Noah, a brave and clever man, fought many battles, and became the king of a large country, called [Assyria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyria); among many other cities, he built the beautiful city of Babylon. After his death, a queen, named [Semiramis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiramis), improved and ornamented it. I will tell you how Semiramis became a queen. Nimrod[^1] had a son, called [Ninus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninus): he also was a great conqueror, and gained many battles; at last, he laid siege to a city called [Bactria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkh), but found it very difficult to obtain possession of this place. Now, one of his chief officers had a wife, named Semiramis: she was a woman of uncommon courage, and had as much sense as courage; her parents were obscure, but I suppose she had taken pains to improve herself, and to make herself brave and skilful. People can do more in teaching themselves than any body can do for them.

Semiramis went to the king, and told him how she thought he might conquer the city of Bactria; the king did as she advised, and he soon gained it. Ninus loved the woman who had shown him the way to gain what he desired; and when the husband of Semiramis saw this, being afraid of the king's power, he went and killed himself When her husband was dead, Ninus married Semiramis: thus she became a queen ; and Ninus, at his death, left her all the countries he possessed.

Semiramis was so fond of Babylon, that she almost built it anew, and added some fine palaces and temples; so that it was long celebrated for its grandeur and beauty. Semiramis was also much admired for her sense and spirit, and for the clever manner in which she governed a great nation. She not only built cities, but she went out with a large army, and fought amidst her soldiers, and obtained many victories. One day, when she was dressing herself, word was brought that there was a tumult in the city; she ran out instantly, with her hair half dressed, and never thought of finishing her dressing till she had restored peace to her people.

Another time, when she was marching a great army against a king of India, as soon as he heard of her coming, he sent to ask her who she was, and why she came against him. "Tell your master," replied Semiramis, "I will soon let him know who I am." They met, and fought; and the king wounded Semiramis in two places; but he did not kill her, for she escaped with part of her army, and returned to Babylon.

Soon after her return, her son rebelled against her; and she, instead of punishing him, gave up the throne to him, and, retiring from court, passed the rest of her life in peace
and privacy.

The Assyrians always loved Semiramis for the good she had done for them. We are told that China, also a vast country in Asia, was well peopled, rich, and flourishing, so far back as the reign of Semiramis.

[Abraham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham), of whom you read in the Bible, was born in [Chaldæa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaldea), a part of Assyria, A. C. 1996, soon after the death of this celebrated queen.
