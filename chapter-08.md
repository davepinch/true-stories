## CHAPTER VIII.

### THE SABINES.

I DO not know how it happened that Rome was in want of women; either they had not any, or they had too few. So [Romulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romulus) sent to the neighboring cities, to ask permission for his people to marry their young virgins. These cities, however, scornfully refused the proposal; so Romulus determined to gain by cunning what he could not obtain by fair and honorable means. He therefore gave notice that, on a certain day, there would be public games, and shows, and feasts, in his city of Rome. Then the proud inhabitants of the adjacent towns came in crowds to see the sights and partake of the festivities. Among the rest, it is said that all the nation of [Sabines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabines), men, women, and children, visited Rome. In the midst of the shows, at a certain signal given, the young Romans rushed upon the strangers, and ran away with the fairest maidens, each taking the one he liked best, and making her his wife. 

The parents of the young girls, you may be sure, were very angry, but, in the confusion, could not find out their children; so they left the city, vowing vengeance on the perfidious Romans; and, indeed, this was a breach of hospitality that no necessity could justify.

A war ensued, and the Sabines gained some advantages, as also did the Romans. At last the two armies met, each resolved to conquer or die. Just before the battle began, the women, who had been the innocent cause of this animosity, with their hair dishevelled, and their garments torn, rushed in between the contending troops: some tried to soften their husbands ; others strove to melt the hearts of their fathers and brothers. They wept, entreated, caressed; â€”declared themselves to be very kindly treated by their husbands, and prayed that peace might be established between relatives so near and dear. Their prayers were granted. The Sabines consented to forgive the Romans, and the Romans were willing to be reconciled to the justly offended Sabines. To obtain and preserve concord is woman's true province.

Peace and confidence were restored, and the nations lived in mutual love and harmony for many years.

After having brought his city into a state of great power and comfort, Romulus died, and was succeeded by [Numa Pompilius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numa_Pompilius), a Sabine, the second king of Rome. It has been said that Romulus was killed; and it has also been said that he was taken up alive to heaven.

Leaving these marvels, I shall have more pleasure in telling you of Numa. He was a wise and virtuous man, living contentedly in privacy. When the throne was offered to him, he wished to decline it; and it was not until his friends had repeatedly urged him to accept it, that he gave up his own wishes to theirs, and, for the public good, consented to be made king of Rome.

He proved as excellent a monarch as he had been a simple citizen, and reigned forty-three years in profound peace, doing every thing possible for the improvement of Rome and the advantage of its inhabitants.

It was in the time of Romulus, about B. C. 732, that a colony from [Corinth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Corinth), a city in Greece, passed over to the island of Sicily, and laid the foundations of [Syracuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syracuse,_Sicily).
