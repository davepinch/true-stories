## CHAPTER XVII.

### XERXES. LEONIDAS. THERMOPYLÆ.

On the death of [Darius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_the_Great), his son [Xerxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerxes_I) succeeded to the throne of Persia. Xerxes was determined to pursue his father's favorite scheme, the conquest of [Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece). He said he would no longer *buy* the figs of [Attica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attica), for he would make himself master of the country, and then all its produce would belong to him. He ordered a passage to be cut through the high mountain of [Athos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Athos), in [Macedonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia_(ancient_kingdom)), and thus made a [canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xerxes_Canal) for his ships.

He is said to have written a letter to Mount Athos, in which "he commanded it not to put stones in the way of his workmen, or he would cut it down and throw it into the sea;" and he ordered the laborers to be flogged, to make them work faster.

When he saw, from a high hill, the plain covered with his soldiers, and the sea with his ships, in the pride of his heart he called himself the most favored of mortals; but, when he reflected that in a hundred years not one of the many thousands he beheld, would be alive, he burst into tears at the instability of all earthly things.

The Hellespont, now called the *[Strait of the Dardanelles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dardanelles)*, is about an English mile across; Xerxes built a bridge of boats over it, which a violent tempest destroyed. This proud king, in his fury, ordered chains to be cast into the sea, and three hundred lashes to be given to the waves, for presuming to injure the works of the master of the ocean.

Almost all the small cities of Greece submitted to him, when he sent to them (as was the custom) for earth and water; which was as much as to ask them whether they would receive him as their conqueror. But [Sparta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta) and [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens), with the small towns of [Thespia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thespiae) and [Platæa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plataea), refused to receive the heralds, or to send the symbol of homage.

Every thing gave way before the conquering march of Xerxes, until he came to the pass of [Thermopylæ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermopylae). On this spot [Leonidas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonidas_I), one of the two reigning kings of Sparta, with a few thousand brave soldiers, awaited his coming. Xerxes, for four days, expected every moment to hear of the flight of this little band; and then he sent to desire them to give up their arms. "Come and take them!" was the short answer of this true native of [Laconia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laconia).

The bravest Persian troops were ordered out against the forces of Leonidas; but they were always driven back with disgrace.

At last, a vile wretch went and informed the king of a secret path by which he could ascend an eminence that overlooked the enemy's camp. The Persians gained this advantageous post during the darkness and silence of night; and the next morning the Greeks discovered that they had been betrayed. Leonidas knew it was in vain to expect his small army could now conquer the endless forces of Xerxes; he therefore sent away his allies, and kept with him only his own three hundred [Lacedæmonians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta). He had been told by the oracle, (that is, by the priest or priestess of some temple, supposed to be inspired by the gods.) that either Sparta or her king must perish; and he longed to die for the good of his dear country.

Xerxes marched his vast army against this brave little band. Leonidas fell among the first, bravely fighting, and covered with wounds. Of the three hundred heroes, only one escaped to bear to Sparta the glorious news that her valiant warriors had died in her defence. But this man was shunned as a coward, until, at the battle of [Platæa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plataea), he proved his extraordinary courage. Xerxes, to his immortal shame, hung up the dead body of the gallant Leonidas on a gibbet. Afterwards, however, a monument was erected at the narrow pass of Thermopylæ to the memory of the brave men who had died there, not vanquished, but overcome by numbers; for the Persian army consisted of three millions of soldiers.

The poet [Simonides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simonides_of_Ceos) wrote a couple of lines on this monument, which are thus translated:

"Go, passenger, and tell Lacedæmon, that we died here in obedience to her laws!"

These heroic Spartans did not die without serving their country; for they not only killed twenty thousand Persians, and detained the rest of the army for some time, so as to give their friends opportunity for preparation, but by their valor they made the Persians fear the prowess of the Greeks.

Is not this one of the most gallant actions you ever read of? It took place B. C. 480; just ten years after the [battle of Marathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Marathon).

[Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt) was now under the government of Xerxes, as were Macedonia and many other countries.
