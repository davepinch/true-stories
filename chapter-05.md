## CHAPTER V.

### CARTHAGE. DIDO. AENEAS.

I HAVE now to inform you of the origin of the magnificent city of [Carthage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carthage), in Africa. It is said to have been built before the [Trojan war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trojan_War); but if so, it was certainly much enlarged and improved by [Queen Dido](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dido).

About the time that [Lycurgus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycurgus_(lawgiver)) died, Dido, or Elissa, (as she is sometimes called,) being provoked at the tyranny of her brother [Pygmalion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_of_Tyre), (who had murdered her husband [Sichaeus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acerbas),) fled with a party from [Tyre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyre,_Lebanon), in Asia, and settled on the coast of Africa. There she bargained for the purchase of as much land as the hide of an ox could enclose; then very artfully cutting the hide, or skin, into narrow strips, she claimed as much ground as those strips would surround.

[Virgil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgil) has written a charming poem, the [Æneid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeneid), which gives a very interesting narrative of Dido, and, as it may have been founded on facts,[^1] I will tell you his story.
[^1]: [Gibbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Gibbon)

You remember that [Troy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy) was taken, after ten years' siege, by the Greeks. Among the Trojans who escaped that bloody day, was a prince, [Æneas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aeneas), who, with his father [Anchises](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchises), his son [Ascanius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascanius), and a few followers, fled by sea from the ruins of Troy.

Æneas and his little party were long driven about by contrary winds; and at last a tempest threw them on the coast of Africa, near the city of Carthage. Dido received them with great kindness; gave them food and clothing, and behaved so compassionately, that Æneas fell in love with her. He soon gained the affections of the queen, and they lived very happily together for many months; but at last Æneas either became tired of her, or his conscience accused him of spending an idle and useless life. 

In spite of the prayers and tears of the tender and faithful Dido, who had done so much for him and his followers; who had refused, for his sake, to marry a great king, and thus drawn upon herself the fury of that king, — Æneas hoisted his sails, and hastened far from Carthage. Dido, broken-hearted at his ingratitude and desertion, resolved to die, according to the barbarous usage of those days, when true religion was unknown; she raised a high pile of wood, and, mounting upon it, stabbed herself, and was burned to ashes with the wood on which she had laid herself.

Carthage was long celebrated for its commerce and wealth; and hereafter I shall have to inform you of some great men, who fought her battles and enlarged her power. This city measured twenty-three miles in circumference. It had a noble park and fine fortress; altogether, it was one of the finest cities that was ever erected; though, at present, the spot on which it stood is scarcely known. So, the period may come when ruins alone shall mark the spot where London, the metropolis of [England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/England), — [London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London), still more celebrated than Carthage for riches and commerce, — now proudly stands.
