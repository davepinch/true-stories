## CHAPTER IV

### LYCURGUS, AND HIS LAWS.

For many years [Sparta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta) was governed by a single king; afterwards, two reigned together. One of these kings left two sons, Polydectes and [Lycurgus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycurgus_(lawgiver)). Polydectes died, and then Lycurgus might have been king, for the widow of Polydectes offered to kill the only son of that prince as soon as it was born, if he would promise to marry her.

But Lycurgus, disdaining so dishonorable a proposal, and wishing to save the child, desired she would send it to him, that he might dispose of it. Accordingly, the boy, as soon as he was born, was sent to his uncle. Lycurgus was at supper with a large party, when the babe arrived: but he instantly took it into his arms, and. holding it to the view of his company, exclaimed, "Spartans, behold your king!" As all the people were delighted to see the son of their deceased monarch, Lycurgus named the boy [Charilaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charilaus), which, I believe, signifies "the joy of the people."

Lycurgus now governed the kingdom until the prince should be old enough to govern for himself; but he found the nation so full of folly and vice, that he resolved to travel into other countries, and discover the best meansoof government.

In his travels, he met with the poems of [Homer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer); he collected these with great care, and took them with him when he returned to Sparta, to which place he was soon recalled by the people. Things were now much worse in this city than when he left it; and he resolved to set about a reformation of the manners of the people. Charilaus at first opposed his plans, but he had sense enough to find they were good, and then he cheerfully forwarded them.

Lycurgus began his labors by instituting a senate, that is, an assembly of the best and wisest men, to make laws, and, see that they were obeyed; this senate was composed of thirty members, the two kings being of the number. He next made an equal division of all the land, so that all the Spartans shared it fairly among them. When he tried to do the same with the movables, the furniture, clothes, &c., he found the rich, who possessed a great deal, very averse to his proposals; so he went another way to work. He took away the value of gold and silver, by ordering the money in future to be made of iron. As this iron money was despised by all the neighboring countries, the Spartans could no longer buy foreign showy articles, so that luxury was at once banished from among them. The workmen, also, not being employed in making useless finery, had more time to give to useful articles, so that the conveniences of life (the things that are *necessary*) were very neatly and completely made and finished.

He then commanded that all persons should eat at public tables, and that those tables should be served with plain food. This regulation vexed the rich Spartans more than any other, so much were they devoted to eating and drinking. They rose in a body and assaulted Lycurgus; and one of them cruelly struck out his eye with a stick. Lycurgus no otherwise punished this offender, [Alcander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcander), than by ordering him to become his page and attendant. Alcander, having a good heart, was so touched by this mildness, that he resolved to be more orderly, and learned in future to govern his passions. In time, these public dinners came to be much relished, and very pleasant discourse often enlivened them.

I never can enough admire one part of the ceremony observed at them. When the company were assembled, the oldest man present, pointing to the door, said, "Not one word spoken here goes out there." This wise rule produced mutual confidence, and prevented all scandal, misrepresentation, and foolish or ill-natured prating.

You will laugh when I tell you, that, at these public dinners, they served up a kind of soup called black broth, which the Spartans enjoyed very much, but which the people of other countries thought sad stuff. The truth was, the Spartans were healthy, and had good appetites, so that any food was acceptable to them.

When you are hungry, you know, you can relish the plainest viands, just as they did their black broth.

The children were taught in large public schools, and were made brave and hardy; all the people were accustomed to speak in short, pithy sentences, so that that style of speaking is even now called after them â€” *laconic*; Laconia being one of the names of Lacedsemonia.

I could tell you much more of this warlike people, but you will read of them in other and better books, when you are older; so I will only add that, when Lycurgus had firmly established his new laws, he took a curious mode of insuring their continued observance. He left Sparta, after having made the people solemnly swear, that they would abide by his laws until he should return. As he intended not to return, this was making them swear they would keep his laws forever.

Lycurgus died in a foreign land. Some say he killed himself; but I hope he was not so wicked. His death happened when Solomon had been dead 100 years, about the 874th year before [Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ).

The [Helots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helots), of whom you will read in the history of Sparta, were a people conquered by the Spartans, and not only deprived of their liberty and made slaves, but often otherwise cruelly used.
