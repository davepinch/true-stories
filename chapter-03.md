## CHAPTER III.

### SPARTA. HELENA. PARIS. HOMER.

[Sparta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta) was built soon after [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens). [Lelex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lelex_(king_of_Sparta)) was its first king; and it had another, called [Lacedasmon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacedaemon_(mythology)), from whom the state was sometimes called Lacedasmonia. The tenth king of Sparta, [Tyndarus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyndareus), had a daughter named [Helena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_of_Troy), who was so beautiful that every body who saw her admired her, and many princes desired to marry her.

Tyndarus knew not whom to choose for her husband; so he made them all take an oath to agree that the lady should choose for herself. Helena fixed upon [Menelaus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menelaus); they were married, and lived together happily enough.

It happened that a very handsome prince, [Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_(mythology)), the son of [Priam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priam), king of Troy, travelling that way, chanced to see Helena, and was so much struck with her beauty, that, as Menelaus was gone from home, he took the opportunity to run away with her.

When Menelaus returned, and found he had lost his wife, he complained very loudly, and stirred up all the cities of Greece to assist him in recovering his Helena.

Greece is in Europe, and was, at that time, full of cities, each governed by its own king. [Troy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troy) was in Asia. At the request of Menelaus, all the Greeks united: it was the first[^1] time they had united; and they laid siege to Troy, where the beauteous Helena was living with the handsome Paris. For ten long years the Greek army strove to regain her; and at the end of that period they took the city, burned it to the ground, and recovered Helena, B. C. 1184. It was by a cunning contrivance that the Greeks entered Troy. They made a large wooden horse, and filled it with armed soldiers; this horse they managed to get into the city; and, at night, when all was still, the men within the hollow horse let themselves out, set fire to Troy, broke down the gates, and gave admission to the Grecian army, which was all in readiness to rush into the town.

Most of this singular history is told in a poem composed by [Homer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homer), and called the *[Iliad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iliad)*. You will read it some day, and see how much bloodshed was caused by the crimes and follies of Helena and her lover Paris.

Homer, who lived 900 years before [Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ), is said to have been a poor blind man, who went about from place to place, singing his verses, and making them as he went along.

I will tell you a pretty fable about Paris, the lover of Helena. A fable, you know, is a story that is not true.

[Peleus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peleus), the father of [Achilles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles), when married to [Thetis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thetis), the mother of Achilles, invited all the gods and goddesses to his wedding, except the [goddess of Discord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eris_(mythology)), who was not asked; this made her so angry, that, to spoil the pleasures of the feast, she threw among the guests a golden apple, with this inscription upon it: "To the fairest." Each goddess, fancying herself the prettiest, expected to receive this curious fruit; but, as all could not have it, [Jupiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_(mythology)) decided that [Juno](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juno_(mythology)), [Minerva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minerva), and [Venus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_(mythology)), should go with Mercury to [Mount Ida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Ida), and have the contest there decided.

Paris, who, though a prince, was also a shepherd, was there tending his father's flocks; and, when desired to say which of these three goddesses was the fairest, after some hesitation, he adjudged the golden apple to Venus. This decision so offended the other two goddesses, Juno and Minerva, that, to punish him and his old father, Priam, they caused him to see and run away with Helena, and then urged the Greek princes to destroy Troy, under pretence of recovering the faithless princess.

Almost all ancient history is entangled with fable, and it is now difficult to determine what is true and what is not. But you may be always sure that is false which describes gods and goddesses; there is but One God, the Lord of heaven and earth.
