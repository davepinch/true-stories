## CHAPTER XII.

### CYRUS.

A FEW years before [Solon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solon) was chosen archon of Athens, a prince was born very worthy of being noticed and admired. This was [Cyrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_the_Great), the son of [Cambyses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambyses_I), king of Persia, and grandson of [Astyages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astyages), king of the [Medes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medes). This Astyages is called Ahasuerus in the Bible.

The manners of the Persians were excellent in those days: great simplicity in dress, food, and behavior, universally prevailed; so that Cyrus was plainly and wisely educated, and learnt to be modest in his demeanor, and moderate in his wishes. When he was yet a boy, his mother, [Mandane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandane_of_Media), took him to visit his grandfather; and the pride and luxury of the court of Media quite surprised and disgusted him. Astyages was so charmed with the sensible conversation and artless manners of the prince, that he loaded him with rich presents, and made a grand entertainment; but Cyrus gave away all the fine things to the courtiers; present to one, because he instructed him; to another, because he was kind to his mother; to a third, because he took care of his old grandfather. All this showed, not only that he was generous, but that he reflected, and gave gifts with judgment, and from motives of gratitude.

Sacas, the cup-bearer, he neglected, because he did not let him visit Astyages when he pleased; and when Astyages lamented this neglect of so good an officer, "O," said the young prince, "there is not much merit in being a good cup-bearer; I can do as well myself." He accordingly took the cup, and handed it to his mother with great modesty and gracefulness. Astyages admired his skill; but laughingly observed, "The young, waiter had forgotten one thing." — "What have I forgotten?" asked Cyrus. "To taste the wine before you handed it to me and your mother." — "I did not forget that; but I did not choose to swallow poison." — "Poison!" exclaimed the king. "Yes; there must be poison in the cup; for they who drink of it sometimes grow giddy and sick, and fall down. — "Then do you never drink in your country?" inquired Astyages. "Yes; but we only drink to satisfy thirst, and then a little water suffices."

I dare say many children must have thought like Cyrus; I only wish, when they grow up, they would remember their thoughts; and then they would not drink strong wine and fiery spirits, which do indeed often cause sick- ness and loss of sense, and, when too freely swallowed, prove a poison. How many are killed by drinking strong liquors!

Soon after this discourse, Cyrus returned home, and was remarkable for his obedience to his father Cambyses, who, in his turn, gave his son very good advice. The prince fought many battles, and was as brave towards his enemies as he was merciful to his prisoners. Do you recollect the anecdote I told you of his pardoning [Croesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croesus), and giving him his life? Well, when this Croesus, who, you know, prized money above all other things, asked Cyrus where he kept his wealth, Cyrus wrote a short note, and sent it to the lords of his court, and presently a large sum of money was brought to him. "Observe," said this noble youth; "the chests in which I keep my riches, are the hearts of my subjects."

He knew that, by his wise and amiable conduct, he had so entirely gained the love and confidence of his people, that he had only to ask, and they would give him all he desired.

I should never have done, were I to tell you all the clever and noble acts that this great prince performed. You must read the full history of his life in [Rollin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Rollin), and you will find it more amusing and instructive than all the novels that were ever written.

I will only add, that, after a long and interesting siege, he took the city of Babylon, and put an end to the Assyrian monarchy, which had subsisted from the time of [Nimrod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimrod). [Belshazzar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belshazzar) was then king of Babylon; and I dare say you have read the account given in the Bible of his seeing a hand-writing on the wall; of Daniel explaining to him that he was about to lose his kingdom; and of the strange manner in which Babylon was entered, and the king taken and killed. The prince who thus conquered was Cyrus the Great. He soon after, by the death of his father, grandfather, and uncle, became sole monarch of Media and Persia, besides other states which he had acquired by his victories. He died at the age of seventy, in the midst of his family and friends, after a life remarkable for virtue and glory, A. C. 529, two years before the death of [Pisistratus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisistratus), tyrant of [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Athens).
