## CHAPTER XIV.

### TARQUINIUS SUPERBUS, SEVENTH AND LAST KING OF ROME

Of 1. [Romulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romulus); 2. [Numa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numa_Pompilius); 3. [Tullus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tullus_Hostilius), you have already heard: of 4. [Ancus Martius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancus_Marcius); 5. [Tarquinius Priscus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Tarquinius_Priscus); 6. [Servius Tullius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servius_Tullius); and 7. [Tarquinius Superbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Tarquinius_Superbus), the remaining kings of [Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome), you have yet to hear.

After the combat of the [Horatii and Curiatti](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horatii_and_Curiatii), Tullus reigned several years, and died, it is said by treason. Ancus Martins, the grandson of Numa, succeeded to the throne: nothing remarkable happened in his reign, except that a stranger, named Lucius, came to live at Rome, and was made guardian of the two sons of Ancus.

When Ancus died, the government as usual, fell into the hands of the senate, and Lucius, by cunning and dissimulation, contrived to be made king. He said his wife had prophesied that he should reign, because, when approaching Rome on his first journey to it, as he was riding in an open car, an eagle caught off his cap, and, after much noise and fluttering, put it on again. In those days, little accidents, which we now think of no consequence, were dwelt upon and explained as boding strange events. You know, when the result is known, it is very easy to fancy that some trifle predicted it.

A crown so unjustly obtained was not long possessed, and probably never enjoyed; for conscience is too busy to let the unjust relish their ill-gotten advantages. Lucius Tarquinius Priscus was murdered, and the sons of Ancus were supposed to have ordered his murder. They fled from Rome, which certainly looked as if they were guilty; innocence does not shun inquiry.

The ambitious wife, who had foreboded Tarquin's elevation, concealed his death until she had caused her son-in-law to be chosen king. This was Servius Tullius: of him, too, she told a strange story, that, when he was a boy and asleep, a bright flame of fire had been seen blazing around his head.

Servius was a good man, and married his two daughters to the two[^1] sons of Tarquinius; and then, having established peace and good government among the Romans, he was preparing to quit the throne and live in retirement. But these intentions were frustrated.
[^1] [Livy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livy)

[Tullia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tullia_Minor), one of his daughters, loved her sister's husband better than her own; and he returned her love, if such wicked wretches could feel love. Tullia killed her husband, as did young Tarquinius his wife, and then they married. As one wickedness paves the way for another, these shameless persons next plotted the death of the good Servius. You will read with horror, that the cruel Tullia rejoiced when she heard that Tarquinius had murdered her father. When she rode forth in her fine chariot to congratulate the base murderer, her driver, seeing the bleeding body of Servius lying in the street, was going to turn down another road, thinking, very rationally, that his mistress would be shocked to behold the mangled corpse of her poor old father. But Tullia had expelled from her heart all natural feeling, and angrily bade the man drive on; he did so, and the chariot-wheels of the daughter's car were stained with the blood of her gray-haired father.

Although the wicked son-in-law was made king, and, from his pride, was entitled Tarquinius Superbus, (Tarquin the Proud,) yet you may be sure all men detested him. He made his children as bad as himself; for he sent his son [Sextus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sextus_Tarquinius) to a city called [Gabii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabii), and commanded him to feign that his father had used him very ill, therefore he had run away. The citizens believed the deceitful Sextus, and were very kind to him, and at last made him their general. This was what Tarquin expected. When his son sent a messenger to know what he must do next, Tarquin gave no answer, but, before the messenger, cut off the heads of the tallest poppies that grew in the garden where he was walking.

No doubt he was afraid of writing or speaking, lest the messenger should betray him; for the wicked always live in the misery of expecting a retaliation of the treachary and cruelty they practise. Sextus, knowing his father's perfidious artifices, understood what he was to do, and without hesitation cut off the heads of all the greatest men in Gabii. The city, no longer protected by brave and prudent citizens, fell an easy prey to the Romans; the treacherous Sextus assisting to betray the nation which had hospitably received him.

Such wicked courses were soon to have an end. Prince Sextus Collatinus, a noble Roman, and some officers, when with the army besieging [Ardea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ardea,_Lazio), a small town not far from Rome, as they were all drinking and carousing, were boasting what excellent wives each possessed. Collatinus was certain that his was the best; so, in a frolic, the young men mounted their horses, and set off for Rome, to discover whose wife was most properly employed in the absence of her husband.

The ladies were found visiting and passing the time in mirth and amusement, all but Lucretia, the wife of Collatinus; and she was spinning wool among her maidens at home. Sextus was so charmed with the good sense and right behavior of [Lucretia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucretia), that he fell in love with her, and wished her to quit her husband, and go away with him. 

Lucretia, shocked at his vile proposals, killed herself for grief, which so distracted Collatinus, that, with [Junius Brutus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Junius_Brutus) and other friends, he raised an army, and drove Sextus and his infamous father from Rome. The people had suffered so much under the tyranny of this king, that they resolved not only that he should never come back, but that they would have no more kings. They therefore appointed two magistrates, called *consuls*, who were to be elected annually; and Collatinus, the husband of Lucretia, and Junius Brutus, her avenger, were the first two consuls who were chosen.
