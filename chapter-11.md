## CHAPTER XI.

### ATHENS. DRACO. SOLON.

The [Athenians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greece) wished much to have written laws; that they might more steadily govern, and more readily know what to obey. They therefore desired [Draco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draco_(lawgiver)), a wise and honest, but a very stern man, to write out a set of rules for them.

Draco did so; and these were the first written laws which history records. But they were most severe; very trifling offences being punished with death, "because," said Draco, "small crimes deserve death, and I have no higher punishment for the greatest transgressions."

This was a strange way of talking; and Draco certainly showed neither mercy nor wisdom by such a remark. Laws are to prevent crimes as well as to punish them. A person chastised moderately for a small offence may be cured of his wickedness, and become virtuous and happy.

Draco's laws were so very harsh that nobody liked to resort to them for the correction of errors and crimes: hence Athens was as badly off as if she had been without laws; and for many years disorder and licentiousness reigned.

One hundred and fifty years after the death of the stern Draco, the Athenians chose [Solon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solon) for their archon, and entreated him to make them some just laws, A.C. 594.

Solon was one of the seven wise men of Greece, and gave a clever answer to [Croesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croesus), king of [Lydia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydia). Croesus was so rich, that even now it is common to say, "as rich as Croesus." This king showed his wealth to Solon, and then asked him, if he did not think the possessor of so much gold the happiest of men. — "No," replied the philosopher; "I know a happier man, an honest laborer, who has just enough to live on." — "And who is the next happiest?" said the king, expecting himself to be named." "The next happiest," answered Solon, "are two virtuous sons, who were remarkable for their duty and kindness to their mother." —"And think you not that I am happy?" exclaimed the disappointed monarch. "No man can be deemed happy till his death," said the sage. When Croesus, afterwards, was taken prisoner by Cyrus, and about to be burnt, he recollected this conversation, and cried out, "Oh! Solon! Solon!" Cyrus inquired wherefore this exclamation; and, when the cause of it was explained, he set Croesus at liberty, and owned himself instructed by the hint of Solon. — Thus the philosopher saved the life of one king, and benefited another.

When setting about altering the laws, the first thing that Solon did was to repeal the laws of Draco; that is, to declare them no longer binding. Next, he endeavored to introduce more equahty of rank and property, by giving power to the lower classes.

He reestablished the [Areopagus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Areopagus). This court had subsisted before, but had fallen into disrepute. Solon, by confining its members to those who had been archons; raised the reputation of the body so much, that it was afterwards greatly venerated. The Areopagus was the highest tribunal in Athens; and took its name from being held upon a hill near the city, called *Areopagus*; that is to say, the *Hill of Ares*, the ancient name of *Mars*.

Many were the useful laws instituted by this wise legislator; and, as they were all mild and reasonable, they were faithfully acted upon; so that Athens greatly improved in virtue and in in wisdom from the archonship of Solon.

You see how much can be done by the exertions of a single man; not only a whole country informed, but a very licentious people rendered remarkably civilized and intelligent.

Solon was intimate with [Thales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thales_of_Miletus), the most celebrated of the [seven Grecian sages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Sages_of_Greece).[^1] He as of [Phoenician](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenicia) origin, and a reputed descendant of [Cadmus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadmus). But his parents had removed to [Miletus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miletus), a town of [Ionia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionia), where Thales was born, A.C. 643. Like others of the ancients, he travelled in quest of knowledge, and visited [Crete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crete), Phoenicia, and Egypt. In the latter country, he was taught by the priests geometry, astronomy, and philosophy; in return he is said to have shown them how to measure the vast height and extent of a pyramid by its shadow — a problem which, at that period, was deemed astonishing, but now has nothing difficult in it beyond the labor of calculation. On his return to Miletus, his reputation for wisdom was very great, and deservedly so; for he was the first who calculated with accuracy a solar eclipse; he examined the origm of the winds, and the cause of thunder and lightning; he discovered the solstices and equinoxes, arranged the order of the seasons, and fixed the number of days in the year at 365. 

[^1]: The names of these seven remarkable personages were, Thales, of Miletus; Solon, the Athenian; [Pittacus, of Mitylene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittacus_of_Mytilene); Periander, of Corinth; [Bias, of Priene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias_of_Priene); [Cleobulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleobulus), of [Lindus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindus), in [Rhodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodes_(city)#History); and [Chilo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilon_of_Sparta), the Spartan: they were mostly contemporaries; and lived between A. C. 665 and 542.

That nothing might interfere with his scientific pursuits, he abstracted himself as much as possible from society; and, when his mother urged him to marry, he replied, "Before my travels, I was too young; I am now too old: between these two extremes a philosopher has no time to think of it." Solon thought otherwise: he was married, and, when he visited Thales, at Miletus, he frequently rallied him on the uncomfortableness of a single life. By way of retaliation, Thales engaged a stranger to come into the room while he was conversing with Solon, and to pretend that he was just arrived from Athens. Solon, being an Athenian, naturally asked what news he brought. The stranger replied, "A promising young man is just dead, for whom the whole city is in mourning." — "What is his name?" inquired Solon, eagerly. "I cannot tell," answered the stranger: "all I know is, that his father is a great philosopher, and is at present travelling at a distance from home." — "Alas! alas!" cried Solon, who doubted not that it was his own son, of whom the stranger spoke; and he began to weep and tear his hair. "Moderate your grief," said Thales, smiling." You now perceive one of the advantages of a single life. Such grief as you now feel can never assail the man who refuses to marry. Be comforted; for this news is not true: your son still lives."

Some Ionians, one day, bargained with a party of Milesian fishermen for the next draught of fishes they should catch. When the net was hauled up, it was found to contain a golden tripod, which, it was reported, [Helen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_of_Troy) had thrown into the sea as she returned from Troy. This, you know, must be a fable. A dispute, as might be expected, arose as to whom the tripod belonged — to the fishermen, or to the lonians; and, as they could not settle the matter themselves they referred the question to the [Delphian oracle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythia). The answer assigned the prize "to the *wisest*." The Milesians, thinking their own philosopher, Thales, the wisest man in the world, sent the tripod to him. But Thales, too modest to deem himself perfect, forwarded it to Bias, another of the Grecian sages; who, for similar reasons, sent it to Pittacus ; and thus it went round, till it came to Solon, whose decision was, that "God alone is truly wise;" and therefore he sent it to Delphi, to be consecrated to the deity of the place.

Thales rendered an important service to Croesus, when he was at a loss how to get his army across the [River Halys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C4%B1z%C4%B1l%C4%B1rmak_River); having neither bridges nor boats for the purpose. The philosopher ordered the men to cut a trench behind the camp, in the form of a crescent, and to make it join the river at its two extremities. The water was thus diverted into another channel, and the river became fordable.

Thales lived to the advanced age of ninety-six years; and died respected for his virtue and admired for his wisdom. The Milesians celebrated his funeral with great pomp, and erected a statue to his memory.

[Thespis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thespis) was the first poet who performed comedies at Athens. He and his immediate successors had no playhouses, but used to act upon an open cart, somewhat as our itinerant show-folks do now. Solon did not disapprove of these shows, and even went himself to see them. But when the play was over, he called Thespis, who had been acting various characters, and asked him if he were not ashamed to speak so many lies? Thespis replied, "It was all in jest." Admire, I beseech yon, the answer of Solon: striking his staff on the ground violently, he cried, "If we encourage ourselves to speak falsely in jest, we shall run the chance of acquiring a habit of speaking falsely in serious matters." Had he never uttered any other words than these, he would have deserved the character of a wise man.

[Aesop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesop), who wrote so many ingenious fables, was much caressed by King Croesus; whilst Solon, for his bluntness, was little noticed. Aesop therefore said, "A man should not converse with kings, unless he says what is agreeable." But Solon nobly answered, "He should not speak, unless he says what is useful."

You will observe that all wise and good persons are equally remarkable for truth. Indeed, there can be no virtue where there is no truth: none but fools and knaves condescend to be false and cunning.

Pisistratus, an Athenian, desiring to gain power, wounded himself; then ran into the market-place, and said his enemies had hurt, him. Solon, with contempt, said to him, "Son of Hippocrates, you act Ulysses badly: he hurt himself to deceive his *enemies*; you have done so to cheat your *friends*."

The populace being, as is generally the case, deaf to the voice of reason, Pisistratus became tyrant, or king, of Athens; and Solon retired to Cyprus, where he died at a good old age, A.C. 558, happy in the consciousness of having done much for his native country.

Whilst Solon and Thales were improving their respective countries of Attica and Ionia, by virtue, wisdom, and science, the republic of Corinth was doomed to suffer under the cruel despotism of [Periander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periander); who, though reckoned among the sages of Greece, rather usurped the title by his power, than deserved it by meritorious deeds. His father had been chief magistrate of the republic; and, when he succeeded him, the first years of his government were mild and popular. But, soon showing a desire to make himself absolute, the people became disaffected, and he sent to [Thrasybulus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrasybulus_of_Miletus), tyrant, or prince, of Miletus, for advice as to the best means of establishing himself. Thrasybulus, instead of sending any reply, took his messenger into a cornfield, and lopped off the heads of all such ears as overtopped the rest. — You recollect a similar story of Tarquin. Periander in this case, as Sextus in the Roman story, understood the symbolical purport of this act; and, surrounding himself with a numerous guard, put to death the richest and most powerful citizens of Corinth. Nor was it towards his subjects only that Periander proved severe and rigorous; he was a cruel husband and a bad father. The only thing that can be said in his favor is, that he was a friend to learning and learned men. He invited the other wise men to his court, and entertained them with respect and hospitality. He was fond of peace, and patronized the fine arts. His apophthegms, or wise sayings, are beautiful, and so contradictory to the actions of his life, that many historians insist that Periander the tyrant was a different person from Periander the wise man. It may be observed, however, that the accounts we have of him were transmitted by his political enemies. He died, as it is said, by his own contrivance, after a reign of forty years, in the eightieth year of
his age, A.C. 585. Notwithstanding his cruelty, his subjects honored his learning, and erected a monument to his memory.

The marvellous adventure of [Arion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arion) is placed in the time of Periander. Arion, the most famous lyric poet and musician of his day, made a voyage to Italy in company with Periander; and, remaining behind, amassed immense wealth by his profession: at length, wishing to return to his native country, [Lesbos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lesbos), he hired a Corinthian vessel at Tarentum, thinking he might safely trust himself and his riches to Corinthian sailors. As soon, however, as the vessel was out at sea, the sailors resolved to throw him overboard, and divide his riches among themselves. Arion entreated them to spare his life; but, finding them inflexible, begged permission to play one tune upon his lute before he died: this was granted: the sailors retired to the middle of the vessel to listen; while Arion, mounting the stern, struck up the "Morning Hymn." As soon as he had finished, he threw himself, with all his jewels, into the sea; and the ship, with its disappointed crew, sailed on to Corinth. So far is probable; what follows, if not altogether fabulous, has been rendered so by the embellishments the story has received. It might be, that Arion was picked up by some other vessel, and conveyed in safety to land; but the legend is, that a immber of dolphins had been attracted round the ship by the melody of his music, and that Arion was carried on the back of one of them to Tsenarus, in Laconia, whence he again set sail, and, arriving at Corinth before the sailors, related to Periander all that had happened. When the sailors came, they were questioned as to the fate of Arion; and they boldly replied that they had
left him well at Tarentum; upon which a door was thrown open, and Arion appeared, clad just as when he made his leap into the sea. This unexpected appearance confounded the guilty sailors; and Periander ordered them
all to be crucified.

About this time the temple of Jerusalem was taken and burnt by Nebuchadnezzar, A.C. 588; and [Sappho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sappho), the lyric poetess, flourished.
