## CHAPTER XV.

# MARATHON. MILTIADES.

It is curious that [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens) should expel her tyrants, the Pisistratidae, (the two sons of [Pisistratus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisistratus),) just about the same time that Rome expelled the Tarquins. The cause, too, was nearly the same — the bad treatment of a woman. The sister of Harmodius was ill used by [Hipparchus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipparchus_(brother_of_Hippias)), one of the Pisistratidae; [Harmodius and his friend Aristogiton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmodius_and_Aristogeiton) succeeded in delivering Athens from her tyrants, but unhappily died themselves, when engaged in destroying Hipparchus. [Hippias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippias_(tyrant)), the other brother, who tried to continue in power, arrested a beautiful woman, named Leona, who, as he thought, knew of the conspiracy, and ordered her to be tortured till she disclosed the truth. But this brave woman bore all her agony in silence; and at last, afraid that extreme pain might force her to speak, she bit off the end of her tongue, to prevent any such weakness, and died faithful to her friends — a noble instance of courage and fidelity.

Hippias was soon compelled to quit Athens. Statues were erected to the memory of Leona, Aristogiton, and Harmodius; and the government was, shortly after, restored to the state in which Solon had left it.

[Callisthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleisthenes), a rich Athenian, strove, indeed, to possess the power he had himself helped to subvert; and, whilst popular, made a few regulations, among which one is well worth notice.

He instituted the *[Ostracism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ostracism)*, which was, that every man of sixty years of age should have the privilege of writing on a tile, or an oyster-shell, the name of any person he desired to have banished from the city. It was then that [Aristides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristides), a person so excellent that he was always entitled "Aristides the Just", was exiled. One of those who voted against him, met Aristides, and, not knowing him, asked him, as he could not write himself, to be so kind as to write on the oyster-shell for him. "What name shall I write?" said Aristides. "Write Aristides," replied the stranger. "And what harm has Aristides done to you, friend, that you should desire his banishment? " asked Aristides. "He has done me no harm," answered the man; " but I am tired of hearing of Aristides *the Just*". Aristides smiled at the folly of the applicant, and doubtless felt well pleased that he was innocent of all offence. He very quietly wrote his own name on the oyster-shell, and thus conduced to his own sentence of exile.

But, before he was exiled, — before he was ungratefully sent away from his own country, — he had performed for that country many eminent services.

[Miltiades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miltiades) was much older than Aristides, and was sent with an army to fight against [Darius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darius_the_Great), king of Persia. Darius was the third king of Persia after [Cyrus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_the_Great); and [Datis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datis) was the Persian general whom Darius had sent, with a large army, to take Athens and burn it to the ground.

Datis met the Athenian forces at [Marathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Marathon), a little town by the sea-side. The Athenians were commanded by ten generals, each of whom, in rotation, commanded for one day; and Miltiades was obliged to take his turn with the others, although he was chief general. Aristides had sense enough to see the evil of such a plan, and generosity enough to give up his honors for the benefit of his country. When it was his day to command, he resigned it to Miitiades, because, he said, "Miitiades was the best general." How much benefit a good example may produce! The other generals, seeing the propriety of this conduct, admired its merit, and imitated what they approved and applauded.

Miltiades, however, thought it his duty not to act till his proper day came round; on the other days, as he had the power, he had the sense to make every necessary preparation. The armies engaged in a fierce and obstinate battle; Themistocles, a brave man, and the compeer of Aristides, fought nobly by his side; from the skill with which Miltiades had placed his troops, as much as from the valor of those troops, the battle of Marathon was won by the Athenians, B. C. 490. A soldier, covered with the blood of the enemy, ran to Athens with the news, and had just strength enough left to say, "Rejoice! the victory is ours!" and then fell down dead from fatigue and wounds.

I am ashamed to tell you that, after this glorious conduct, Miltiades died in prison, where he was put by the Athenians, because he could not pay a fine which they levied on him. On a false pretence of treachery to his country, this excellent general had been condemned to death; and afterwards the sentence of death was changed to a fine.

Aristides, you have heard, was banished; so, it seems, the Athenians were a most ungrateful people. When Aristides was quitting the city, instead of expressing any anger or revenge, he prayed to the gods that nothing might happen to make his country regret his absence. This was returning good for evil; this was the behavior of a truly noble mind.

[Themistocles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Themistocles), from jealousy of the merit of Aristides, voted for his banishment; but, although so unkind in that action, on other occasions he acknowledged and praised the virtues of Aristides.

The Athenians had the sense to recall Aristides; and by and by you shall hear more about him. I will now finish with an anecdote about Themistocles. When he was in power, he laughingly said, that his son was greater than any man in Greece. — "How is that?" said a friend. "Why," replied Themistocles, "the Athenians govern Greece; *I* command the Athenians; his mother commands me; and this boy commands his mother!"

[Pythagoras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagoras) died about this time; he thought that when the soul quitted the body of man, it passed into the bodies of animals. This is called the "transmigration of souls;" of course, none of his sect ate flesh, for fear they should devour their friends and relations.
