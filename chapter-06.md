## CHAPTER VI.

### THE OLYMPIADS.

There are many ways of measuring time: we say such an event occurred in such a year of the world. [*Anno Mundi*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Mundi); marked thus, A.M.: that is, when the world was so many years old.

Or, we say, it happened [*Before Christ*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini) B.C., or [*Ante Christum*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ante_Christum_natum) A.C.; that is, so many years before [Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ) was born.

Or, we say, a circumstance came to pass in such a year of such an [Olympiad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympiad); you shall hear what is meant by this last expression.

Every four years, at [Olympia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympia,_Greece), or [Pisa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pisa,_Greece), both towns of Greece, certain public games were celebrated in honor of the heathen god Jupiter. These games consisted of chariot races, horse races, wrestling, throwing the disc or
coit, and boxing with the cestus; the cestus was a gauntlet, or glove, made of an ox-hide. One of the wrestlers being once entangled by his dress, the men from that time wrestled naked, with their bodies greased, or oiled, to prevent their being held firmly by their antagonists. The reward of the victor was a simple wreath of the wild olive; hence it seems they fought for glory, not for riches. The conquerors were talked of all over Greece and the neighboring states, so that young men flocked from all parts to contend at these games; and, as they caused the candidates to practise manly exercises, and thence to become robust and daring, these games were very considerable.

Women were not allowed to be present: indeed, few would have desired it. There was once a female, who, wishing to see her two sons perform, put on man's attire, and mixed with the crowd. It happened that her sons were declared to be the victors; and when she heard this, the joy of the mother overmatched the prudence of the woman She ran from her place, jumped over the cord that was fixed to keep back the spectators, and, throwing off her manly robe, declared her sex. The people were amazed; but, in consideration of the merit of her sons, the fault of the mother was pardoned.

From that time, however, a stricter vigilance was used to prevent the entrance of females.

The Olympic Games were first instituted about 1453 A.C.; but having fallen into disuse, they were restored by [Pelops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelops), 1307 A.C.

But the Olympiads, from which history is sometimes reckoned, were established 776 A.C.; an epocha you must be careful to remember, not only as the period from which ancient history is generally dated, but because it is very near the time when the far-famed city of Rome was built.
