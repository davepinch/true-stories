## CHAPTER II

### EGYPT. NILE. PYRAMIDS. LETTERS. SESOSTRIS.

The second country of which we read is [Egypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Egypt); and here is the map. Egypt is in Africa, in the corner which joins it to Asia. [Menes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menes) was the first king of Egypt: he reigned about 160 years after [Nimrod](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimrod), but before [Semiramis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiramis).

Egypt is famous for many things; such as the [River Nile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nile), which overflows its banks once every year, and with the water carries a rich earth over the surrounding land, that not only moistens but improves it; so that, when the water retires, the ground is in a fine state for tilling and sowing.

You have heard of those wonderful buildings, the [Pyramids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_pyramids). They are to be seen at this day in Egypt, and are so old that nobody can find out when they were raised, or for what use; but it is supposed they were meant for sepulchres, a kind of graves, for the dead.

In Egypt, letters were first invented by a man called Memnon, more than 3000 years ago; from that time, men have had signs with which to write down what they think and what they wish to remember.

Egypt had also a very great monarch, named [Sesostris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesostris), who reigned there long and happily; he was father to Amenophis, the Pharaoh under whom the Israelites departed out of Egypt, and who was drowned in the [Red Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea), when pursuing them. Look into the map, and you will find the Red Sea between Egypt and [Canaan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canaan), in Assyria; so that the shortest way for the Israelites to return home was by crossing it. I must tell you that Pharaoh was a royal title, common to all the kings who, in those times, reigned in Egypt

The father of Sesostris was resolved to educate his son so well that he should become a great and good man. By his orders, all the children born in Egypt on the same day as Sesostris were brought to court, and instructed with the young prince. They were all treated alike: by these means, Sesostris not only made many friends, but many clever boys were educated, who proved able and faithful ministers to him. The prince and his companions were brought up very hardily; they were never suffered to eat until they had run or ridden a race. They were taught the use of arms, and were made to bear hunger and thirst patiently.

As soon as they were strong enough, they were sent to fight the enemies of their country. Whilst Sesostris was absent on such an expedition, his father died; and then he resolved to attempt the conquest of all the world. But, before he began this great undertaking, he tried to secure the safety of his own country, by choosing sensible ministers, and by gaining the love of his people.

He conquered many nations; but, after obtaining from them whatever he thought most useful for his own country, he restored to them their freedom. We are told that in several places he erected pillars, with hieroglyphic inscriptions to this effect upon them : "Sesostris, king of kings, and lord of lords, subdued this country by the power of his arms." On his return home, a wicked brother of his tried to destroy him, by setting fire to the palace in which he, his wife, and children, were sleeping; but they all escaped the danger.

Sesostris dug canals, encouraged commerce, and in so many ways benefited his subjects, that I am sorry truth obliges me to inform you of an instance of his pride and vain-glory. He was so puffed up with his conquests, that, fancying himself more than man, he made the princes he had vanquished do him homage, and would go to the temple with those poor princes harnessed to his car instead of horses. This was shameful; but he did still worse; for, when he was old and blind, he wickedly put an end to his own life.

In his reign, B. C. 1556, [Cecrops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cecrops_I) led a colony out of Egypt, and built the city of [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens), of which place I have much to tell you; and the brother who had sought his death, afraid of the punishment he deserved, took to flight. After many years' wandering, he repaired to [Argos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argos,_Peloponnese), and took possession of that city. About this time, also, Scamander built Troy, B. C. 1546, soon after the birth of [Moses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses).
