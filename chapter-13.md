## CHAPTER XIII.

### CONFUCIUS. CHINA.

I HAVE already told you of two great lawgivers, [Lycurgus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lycurgus_(lawgiver)) of [Sparta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparta), and [Solon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solon) of [Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athens); I have now to tell you of a third, [Confucius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius), the legislator of China. Confucius was born just before Solon died, when [Cyrus the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyrus_the_Great) was in the height of his power, and the prime of his life.

The Chinese pretend that [Noah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noah) (whom they call Fo-hee) settled in the north part of China, and that therefore their nation is derived from him; certain it is, that the empire of China is of high antiquity.

Confucius was a very grave child, not fond of play, very studious, and very devout. When only twenty-three years of age, he began to attempt the reform of his countrymen, who were immersed in dissipation and extravagance.

The virtue and ability of Confucius caused him to be much respected, and he was chosen to fill offices of high dignity. He was very happy to accept the situation of a magistrate, because he hoped to be more useful to his fellow-citizens; and he exerted himself very much, until, finding that, in spite of all his exertions, the people were little amended, he gave up places that he only valued as extending his capacity of doing good. He then travelled about different parts of this vast empire; and, on his again settling in his native province, he was invested with an important office in the government. At that time, China was composed of many kingdoms, each governed by its own sovereign.

Confucius wished a king to reign amidst his subjects as a father amongst his children, and wrote many books, and took many journeys, to bring about so desirable a form of government. No doubt, he did much good, but certainly not so much as he desired and deserved. He was wont to say to his followers, "There are four things that make me uneasy: 1st, my small progress in virtue; 2d, my want of enthusiasm in study; 3d, my defects in the administration of justice; 4th, my insufficient regulation of my temper."

These were the modest sentiments of a man renowned for his virtue, his learning, his justice, his self-control. We plainly see that the best people are the most humble; the wisest are the most diffident.

A few days before his death, he said to his friends and attendants, "Kings refuse to attend to my precepts: then let me die, since I can no longer be useful to the world." He peaceably expired in the arms of his friends, gray-headed, and enriched by wisdom and byworth.

After his death, his true value was known; and his memory, from that hour, has been honored and respected by the Chinese. Many temples have been inscribed with his name, and many ceremonies are performed in his honor. They worship him as the greatest legislator and wisest man that ever lived. The history he wrote is venerated; the pre- cepts he strove to inculcate are held most precious.

Thus, it seems, worth and excellence are sure to be duly prized, if not during the life of the individual, yet after his death. At the same time that Confucius flourished in China, [Zoroaster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroaster) is by some supposed to have lived in Persia. Zoroaster taught the Persians to reverence the sun and fire, as representatives of the one true God. By many writers, however, the era of Zoroaster is carried back as far as the time when [Abraham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham) was called out
of [Ur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ur) of [Chaldaea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaldea), A.C. 1926.
